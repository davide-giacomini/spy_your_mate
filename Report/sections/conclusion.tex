\section{Conclusion}

I reported here the steps that I have taken to work on the joint project of Wireless Internet and Internet of Things, analyzing the quality of the training and the predictions.

I can conclude here that, based on the results obtained during the tests, even though the communication between two parties is encrypted in Zoom\footnote{\href{https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362723-Encryption-for-Meetings}{support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362723-Encryption-for-Meetings}}, important information can be easily extracted sniffing packets and analyzing some of their features through a Machine Learning algorithm. This conclusion is strong when we consider that those features are never encrypted as they are necessary for a correct protocol procedure in the Internet.

My conclusion can be also extended recognizing a better prediction when the person is actually in front of the camera rather than when there is nobody.
