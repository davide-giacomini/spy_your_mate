\section{Further Improvements}

This work could be improved with a better and bigger dataset, in order to try different combinations of captures. Moreover, I think that if there are some valid features that I missed in my work, it could be a strong improvement even without amplifying the dataset.

Moreover, I was unfortunately alone and I did not try to make a real video call, instead I called myself between laptop and smartphone. Considering the local Wifi network, the only external information the algorithm can extract is the one coming from the Zoom server and not from the other endpoint of the communication. I did however involved other people during the call, in order to have some data with more than one person in front of the camera. I although strongly believe that, overall, this work can be improved with a better environment.
