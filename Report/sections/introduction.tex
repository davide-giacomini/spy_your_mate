\section{Introduction}
In this report I am going to illustrate the work done for the joint project of Wireless Internet and Internet of Things.

I was required to extract some information from a video call with a provider of my choice. In particular, I was requested to analyze the traffic generated by a webcam call and, from such traffic, identify whether a person or only the background is recorded in the video. I was asked to capture the network traffic and filter all the video call packets. Subsequently, I had to extract some important features from the captured packets, and use those features to train a model of Machine Learning. Finally, I had to predict the presence of a person in the background using the trained model and compare the prediction with the ground truth. For the comparison, I had to use a Node-RED chart.

You can find all my code on GitHub\footnote{\href{https://github.com/davide-giacomini/spy_your_mate}{github.com/davide-giacomini/spy\_your\_mate}}. It has three folders that divide everything between Node-RED, Python and Latex (for this report).
